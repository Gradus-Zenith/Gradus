# 📚 Gradus – Your AI-Powered Learning Companion

**Gradus** is a next-generation EdTech platform that transforms how students learn from YouTube by turning chaotic, scattered educational content into structured, interactive, and personalized learning experiences. Powered by **Orion**, our in-house AI built on Gemini 2.0, Gradus bridges the gap between modern learners and quality education.

## 🚀 Why Gradus?

The education system is broken. Rigid schedules, outdated methods, and a one-size-fits-all model dominate traditional and online platforms alike. YouTube may offer free educational content, but it's noisy, unstructured, and lacks engagement.

**Gradus** fixes this by combining the vastness of YouTube with the precision of AI to deliver a *smart, personalized, and gamified* learning experience.
